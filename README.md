# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
This repository contains various data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of common data structures and algorithms for educational purposes.

## Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks (Array-based, Linked-list based)
- Queues (Array-based, Linked-list based)
- Trees (Binary, Binary-Search AVL, Red-Black)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps (Min, Max)

## Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort)
- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

## How to Use
Each data structure and algorithm has its own Java class with a main method that demonstrates its usage. To run a specific class, simply navigate to the corresponding directory and run the following command:

````
javac <filename>.java
java <filename>
````

## Contribution
If you find any bug or have any suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or a pull request.
